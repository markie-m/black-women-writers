                <p><q>There is always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.</q><br> ― <a href="https://www.theamandagorman.com/" target="_blank">Amanda Gorman</a></p>
                <p class="intro hooks">When <a href="https://www.berea.edu/appalachian-center/appalachian-center-home/faculty-and-staff/bell-hooks/" target="_blank">bell hooks</a> says, <q>No black woman writer in this culture can write 'too much.' Indeed... no woman has ever written enough,</q> she reminds us that, as American readers fed a diet of largely "white supremacist capitalist patriarchal" rhetoric, it's up to us to make a point to <em>seek out, read, and otherwise support the work of Black women writers.</em></p>
                <p class="intro">Let us do as the great <a href="https://www.oprah.com/">Oprah Winfrey</a> says and <q>have the courage to step out of our history and past so that we can live our dreams.</q></p>
